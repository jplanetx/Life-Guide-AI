## Accomplished Tasks
1. Frontend Development
   - Successfully resolved dependency issues
   - Fixed TypeScript compilation errors
   - Implemented Eisenhower Matrix UI
   - Added TaskDetails component
   - Added AI Assistant interface

2. Frontend-Backend Integration
   - Established basic API connectivity
   - Set up task service structure
   - Implemented task management endpoints
   - Added environment configuration

3. Environment Setup
   - Cleaned and reinstalled node modules
   - Updated package dependencies
   - Fixed React type definitions
   - Resolved build issues

## Technical Documentation
1. Frontend Changes:
   - Added dependencies:
     ```json
     {
       "lucide-react": "latest",
       "@types/react": "^18.0.0"
     }
     ```
   - Fixed TypeScript configurations
   - Implemented proper component interfaces
   - Added type definitions for task structures

2. Known Issues:
   - Tasks not appearing in Eisenhower Matrix
   - Task creation may not be properly connected to backend
   - AI Assistant needs proper connection to backend chat endpoint

3. Configuration Updates:
   - Updated package.json with new dependencies
   - Fixed build configuration
   - Updated TypeScript settings

## Critical Highlights
1. Breaking Changes:
   - Updated component props interfaces
   - Changed task service implementation
   - Modified environment configuration

2. Technical Debt:
   - Need proper error handling
   - Missing loading states
   - Requires proper task synchronization
   - Needs better state management

3. Known Limitations:
   - Task creation not fully integrated
   - Missing task update functionality
   - AI chat integration incomplete
   - No proper error states

## Decision Context
1. Architecture Decisions:
   - Chose to implement frontend in React with TypeScript
   - Used Tailwind for styling
   - Implemented modular component structure
   - Separated concerns between UI and data layer

2. Next Steps:
   - Implement proper task fetching from backend
   - Connect task creation to Notion database
   - Complete AI chat integration
   - Add proper error handling
   - Implement loading states
   - Add task synchronization
   - Implement proper state management

3. Areas Needing Attention:
   - Backend-frontend data flow
   - Task management integration
   - Error handling
   - Loading states
   - State management
   - User feedback
   - Data synchronization

## Code Changes
- Updated frontend dependencies
- Fixed component TypeScript interfaces
- Implemented proper task handling
- Added AI chat component structure
- Fixed build configuration

## Testing Updates
- Verified frontend build process
- Confirmed TypeScript compilation
- Tested basic UI functionality
- Verified component rendering

## Performance Metrics
- Build time: < 30s
- TypeScript compilation: Clean
- React rendering: Responsive
- No console errors
