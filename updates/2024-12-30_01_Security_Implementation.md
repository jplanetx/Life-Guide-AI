# AI Coach Update - Security Implementation

## Timestamp and Model
- Date: December 30, 2024 12:00 EST
- Model: Claude-3.5-Sonnet (October 2024)

## Accomplished Tasks
1. Repository Security Clean-up
   - Created new clean repository: Life-Guide-AI
   - Removed exposed API keys from git history
   - Implemented proper .gitignore configuration
   - Set up pre-commit hooks for security scanning

2. Security Infrastructure
   - Added security workflow for GitHub Actions
   - Implemented detect-secrets baseline
   - Added comprehensive .gitignore patterns
   - Set up environment variable validation

3. Code Security Measures
   - Added rate limiting framework
   - Implemented API key validation structure
   - Enhanced environment variable validation
   - Added security-focused dependencies

## Technical Documentation
1. API Changes:
   - Added API key header validation structure
   - Prepared rate limiting middleware

2. Dependencies Added:
   ```
   pre-commit==3.6.0
   detect-secrets==1.4.0
   bandit==1.7.6
   slowapi==0.1.8
   python-jose[cryptography]==3.3.0
   ```

3. Configuration Updates:
   - Added .pre-commit-config.yaml
   - Created .secrets.baseline
   - Updated .gitignore patterns
   - Added GitHub Actions security workflow

## Critical Highlights
1. Breaking Changes:
   - Repository moved to new clean location
   - Added structure for API key requirement (not enforced yet)

2. Security Considerations:
   - All sensitive data removed from git history
   - Pre-commit hooks prevent secret commits
   - Environment variable validation added

3. Known Limitations:
   - Rate limiting prepared but not enforced
   - Security measures suitable for development, need review before production
   - Some security features (API key validation) are structured but not enforced

## Decision Context
1. Architecture Decisions:
   - Created new repository instead of cleaning old one for cleaner history
   - Implemented security in phases to maintain development velocity
   - Focused on preventive measures over reactive ones

2. Next Steps:
   - Enforce rate limiting when needed
   - Implement comprehensive API authentication
   - Add input validation
   - Set up logging for security events
   - Complete security review before packaging

3. Areas Needing Attention:
   - Production security requirements
   - API authentication implementation
   - Comprehensive security testing
   - Logging and monitoring

## Code Changes
- `/backend/src/main.py`: Added rate limiting structure
- `/backend/src/core/dependencies.py`: Added API key validation
- `/backend/src/core/config.py`: Enhanced environment validation
- `/.github/workflows/security.yml`: Added security scanning
- `/.pre-commit-config.yaml`: Added pre-commit configuration

## Configuration Changes
Added to project root:
- .pre-commit-config.yaml
- .secrets.baseline
- GitHub Actions workflow

## Testing Updates
- Pre-commit hooks tested and verified
- Security workflow implemented
- Environment variable validation tested

## Performance Metrics
- No significant performance impact from security measures
- Rate limiting configured but not enforced
